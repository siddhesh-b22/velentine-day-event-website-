 # ðŸ’˜ Funny Valentine | Love or Leave?

Welcome to the **Funny Valentine** website! ðŸ˜„ðŸ’–

This is a super fun, playful site where you get to decide whether to say **YES** or **NO** to a Valentineâ€™s proposal. Will you choose love? Or will you leave us hanging? ðŸ˜‚ Either way, weâ€™ve got you covered with some humor and cute surprises. ðŸ¥°

### What's Inside?

1. **Main Page** - A Valentineâ€™s proposal with a *super* cute design and two big buttons: one to say **YES**, and another to say **NO**.
2. **Yes Page** - When you say **YES**, youâ€™ll be greeted with a fun and celebratory page. ðŸŽ‰
3. **No Page** - If you hit **NO**, weâ€™ll let you rethink your choice in a funny and cute way. Donâ€™t worry, we wonâ€™t hold it against you! ðŸ˜œ

### Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: Two big choices: **YES** or **NO**. Click one, and the page changes based on your answer!
- **Animations**: The hearts, buttons, and images have playful animations, from pulsing hearts to moving buttons. ðŸ¥°
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Perfect for phones and tablets â€“ everything looks great on any screen. ðŸ“±
- **Fun Visuals**: Weâ€™ve got GIFs, hearts, and some fun messages. Itâ€™s a Valentineâ€™s experience you wonâ€™t forget! ðŸ’˜

### How to Use the Site

1. **Open the site**: Simply open the **`main.html`** file in your browser to start the journey.
2. **Make a choice**: Youâ€™ll be given two buttons â€“ one to say **YES**, and the other to say **NO**. 
3. **Enjoy the ride**: Based on your decision, youâ€™ll be redirected to either a celebration page or a fun "think again" page!

### File Structure (For Devs/Curious People)

Hereâ€™s how the siteâ€™s set up:

```
/root
  â”œâ”€â”€ main.html           # The Valentineâ€™s proposal page. Big hearts, big choices.
  â”œâ”€â”€ yes.html            # You said YES! Time to celebrate with some fun animations.
  â”œâ”€â”€ no.html             # You said NO! But donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ve got some fun waiting for you.
  â””â”€â”€ /assets
      â””â”€â”€ sticker.jpg     # A cute image used on the NO page (because we all need a laugh!)
```

### How It Works

- **HTML** is used for the structure (duh!).
- **CSS** is where the magic happens â€“ we used it for all the fun styles, colors, and animations.
- **JavaScript** is responsible for making the buttons interactive, like the **NO** button that randomly moves around when you try to click it. (Sneaky little thing!) ðŸ˜œ

### Customization

- **Want to personalize it?** Change the text, background, or even the GIFs! You can make it your own.
- **Feeling creative?** Adjust the animations, fonts, and styles to make it fit your vibe.
